h1. rah_status_dropdown

*Status options are rendered as a select field in current Textpattern CMS versions. This plugin is deprecated.*

Rah_status_dropdown is a visual admin-side extension for "Textpattern CMS":https://textpattern.com. The plugin changes _Write_ panel's _status_ radio buttons to a select field. Changing the list of statuses to a dropdown will save some space, and hides the extra article statuses that might have no real use to a content author.
